# Playwright

Sample code for the playwright gearup, forked from a simple counter-App made using [React.js](https://reactjs.org) by @arnab-datta on GitHub

> **This tiny application mimics adding, removing, deleting, and resetting products within a shopping cart.**

This is a very basic app, but useful to understand the React Components, states, Data Flow, parent to child etc.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TODOs:

#### src/index.css

1. Create a dark mode for the application using media queries

#### tests/app.test.ts

2. add a test for clicking the increment button
3. add a test for clicking the decrement button
4. add a test for multiple increments and decrements
5. add any remaining tests needed (e.g. the reset button, delete button, etc.)
