# Playwright

Sample code for the playwright gearup, forked from a simple counter-App made using [React.js](https://reactjs.org) by @arnab-datta on GitHub

> **This tiny application mimics adding, removing, deleting, and resetting products within a shopping cart.**

This is a very basic app, but useful to understand the React Components, states, Data Flow, parent to child etc. This app has a version with firebase authentication and storage, and without. To access the version with it, navigate to the branch title feat/auth-and-storage
